# Kaitlyn Azzolina - Portfolio Project

## About the App

This app is a full stack React app using Express and Node.js as the backend. This app was created to display my resume and accomplishments in a view that would also show my coding skills. This is my first side project that I created and worked on while attending school at Ohio State University full-time.

If this is your first time running this application, you will have to install the dependencies needed. If you do not already have nodemon installed, install that globally with `npm install -g nodemon`.

**Steps to run the backend:**

1. Navigate to the `server` folder where all the backend is stored

        cd server

2. Run the Express server

        npm run dev

**Steps to run the frontend:**

1. Navigate to the `client` folder where all the frontend is stored

        cd client

2. If you have not ran this app once before, install all react dependencies

        npm install

3. Run the React server

        npm run start
